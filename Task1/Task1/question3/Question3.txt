We do have 2 tables in a relational database: 
∙ Clients (client_id(PK), client_name) 
∙ Orders (order_id(PK), client_id, order_sum, order_date) 
Please write the following SQL queries: 
  a- list of clients, which have an order with order_sum > 50 
  b- clients, whose total sum of orders exceeds 100
